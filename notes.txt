Will need to take into account the one cyle delay of reading from bram. Meaning when you select the place you want to read out of, it will take one extra cycle. This may cause issues when reading from memory and loading it into a register.


LC counts
  16 bit word size, not using BRAM
  -------
  Satya implementation using mem and vmem

  with everything: LCs          2530 / 7680
  without divider: LCs          2496 / 7680
  without mult: LCs          2145 / 7680
  without sub: LCs          2112 / 7680


LC and BRAM Counts:
  -----
    16 Bits with imem and dmem 16 bits and 1024 addresses
        LCs          1115 / 7680
        BRAMs        8 / 32
